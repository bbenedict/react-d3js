# react-d3js

A simple react app that explores using d3.js for chart rendering and data visualization.  

This repo is inspired by the book *Fullstack D3 and Data Visualization: Build beautiful data visualizations with D3 by Amelia Wattenberger* published by Fullstack.io. I highly recommend this book!
